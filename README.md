# WTGF

Title: Weighted Forwarding in Graph convolution networks for Recommendation

Train Log(Wandb): https://wandb.ai/d9249/WFGR <br>
Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dodo9249/wtgf <br>
Dataset(Google Drive): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11zFVhE0tM0HKnKJZ-YvptjOBYC3Ok5g3?usp=sharing <br>
The experiments in this paper are based on <b>[RecBole-GNN](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole-GNN)</b>, and the entire experiment was conducted by modifying the code of that library.
